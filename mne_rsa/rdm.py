    ----------
    data : ndarray, shape (n_items, ...)
        For each item, all the features. The first dimension are the items and

    metric : str | function
        The distance metric to use to compute the RDM. Can be any metric
        supported by :func:`scipy.spatial.distance.pdist`. When a function is
        specified, it needs to take in two vectors and output a single number.

        parameter for the distance function.

    """Generate RDMs from an array of data, possibly in a searchlight pattern.

    First use :class:`searchlight` to compute the searchlight patches.
    Then you can use this function to compute RDMs for each searchlight patch.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : ndarray, shape (n_items, n_series, n_times)
        An array containing the data.
    patches : generator of tuples | None
        Searchlight patches as generated by :class:`searchlight`. If ``None``,
        no searchlight is used. Defaults to ``None``.
    dist_metric : str | function
        The distance metric to use to compute the RDMs. Can be any metric
        supported by :func:`scipy.spatial.distance.pdist`. When a function is
        specified, it needs to take in two vectors and output a single number.

        Defaults to 'correlation'.
    dist_params : dict
        Extra arguments for the distance metric used to compute the RDMs.
        Refer to :mod:`scipy.spatial.distance` for a list of all other metrics
        and their arguments. Defaults to an empty dictionary.
    y : ndarray of int, shape (n_items,) | None
        For each item, a number indicating the class to which the item belongs.
        When ``None``, each item is assumed to belong to a different class.
        Defaults to ``None``.
    n_folds : int | sklearn.model_selection.BaseCrollValidator | None
        Number of cross-validation folds to use when computing the distance
        metric. Folds are created based on the ``y`` parameter. Specify
        ``None`` to use the maximum number of folds possible, given the data.
        Alternatively, you can pass a Scikit-Learn cross validator object (e.g.
        ``sklearn.model_selection.KFold``) to assert fine-grained control over
        how folds are created.
        Defaults to 1 (no cross-validation).

    Yields
    ------
    rdm : ndarray, shape (n_patches, n_items * (n_items - 1))
        A RDM (in condensed form) for each searchlight patch.

    Attributes
    ----------
    shape : tuple of int
        Multidimensional shape of the generted RDMs.

        This is useful for re-shaping the result obtained after consuming the
        this generator.

        For a spatio-temporal searchlight:
            Three elements: the number of time-series, number of time
            samples and length of a consensed RDM.
        For a spatial searchlight:
            Two element: the number of time-series and length of a condensed
            RDM.
        For a temporal searchlight:
            Two elements: the number of time-samples and length of a condensed
            RDM.
        For no searchlight:
            One element: the length of a condensed RDM.
