class searchlight:
    """Generate indices for searchlight patches.

    Generates a sequence of tuples that can be used to index a data array.
    Depending on the spatial and temporal radius, each tuple extracts a
    searchlight patch along time, space or both.

    This function is flexible in regards to shape of the data array. The
    intepretation of the dimensions is as follows:

    4 or more dimensions
        ``(n_folds, n_items, n_series, n_samples, ...)``

    3 dimensions
        ``(n_items, n_series, n_samples)``

    2 dimensions
        ``(n_items, n_series)`` when ``spatial_radius`` is not ``None``.
        ``(n_items, n_samples)`` when ``temporal_radius`` is not ``None``.

    1 dimension
        ``(n_items,)``

    The returned tuples will match the dimensions of the data array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : tuple of int
        The shape of the data array to compute the searchlight patches for, as
        obtained with the ``.shape`` attribute.
    dist : ndarray or sparse matrix, shape (n_series, n_series) | None
        The distances between all source points or sensors in meters.
        This parameter needs to be specified if a ``spatial_radius`` is set.

        Since the distance matrix can be huge, sparse matrices are also
        supported. When the distance matrix is sparse, all zero distances are
        treated as infinity. This allows you to skip far away points during
        your distance computations.

        Defaults to ``None``.
    spatial_radius : float | list of list of int | None
        This controls how spatial patches will be created. There are several
        ways to do this:

        The first way is to specify a spatial radius in meters. In this case,
        the ``dist`` parameter must also be specified. This will create a
        searchlight where each patch contains all source points within this
        radius.

        The second way is to specify a list of predefined patches. In this
        case, each element of the list should itself be a list of integer
        indexes along the spatial dimension of the data array. Each element of
        this list will become a separate patch using the data at the specified
        indices.

        The third way is to set this to ``None``, which will disable the making
        of spatial patches and only perform the searchlight over time. This can
        be thought of as pooling everything into a single spatial patch.

        Defaults to``None``.
    temporal_radius : int | None
        The temporal radius of the searchlight patch in samples. Set to
        ``None`` to only perform the searchlight over sensors/source points.
        Defaults to ``None``.
    sel_series : ndarray, shape (n_selected_series,) | None
        When set, searchlight patches will only be generated for the subset of
        time series with the given indices. Defaults to ``None``, in which case
        patches for all series are generated.
    samples_from : int
        When set, searchlight patches will only be generated for the subset of
        time samples with indices equal or greater than the given value. Only
        used when the given data shape includes a temporal dimension.
        Defaults to 0.
    samples_to : int
        When set, searchlight patches will only be generated for the subset of
        time samples with indices up to, but not including, the given value.
        Only used when the given data shape includes a temporal dimension.
        Defaults to -1, which means there is no upper bound.

    Yields
    ------
    patch : tuple of (slice | ndarray)
        A single searchlight patch. Each element of the tuple corresponds to a
        dimension of the data array and can be used to index along this
        dimension to extract the searchlight patch.
