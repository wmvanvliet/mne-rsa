Sensor-level RSA using a searchlight
====================================

This example demonstrates how to perform representational similarity analysis
(RSA) on EEG data, using a searchlight approach.

In the searchlight approach, representational similarity is computed between
the model and searchlight "patches". A patch is defined by a seed point (e.g.
sensor Pz) and everything within the given radius (e.g. all sensors within 4
cm. of Pz). Patches are created for all possible seed points (e.g. all
sensors), so you can think of it as a "searchlight" that moves from seed
point to seed point and everything that is in the spotlight is used in the
computation.

The radius of a searchlight can be defined in space, in time, or both. In
this example, our searchlight will have a spatial radius of 4.5 cm. and a
temporal radius of 50 ms.

The dataset will be the kiloword dataset [1]_: approximately 1,000 words were
presented to 75 participants in a go/no-go lexical decision task while
event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded.
